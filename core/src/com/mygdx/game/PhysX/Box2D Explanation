In our game world we have different layers:
a) Background Layer
b) Objects Layer (Polygon/Rectangular squares for collision detection)

Box2D locates these rectangles and puts it in a physics world, so
our ship can actually collide with them

Structure of Box2D:
wolrd ( everything inside of it is affected by physics )
    bodies
        mass
        velocity
        location
        angles
        fixtures (phyiscal attributes of bodies )
            shape
            density
            friction
            restitution
